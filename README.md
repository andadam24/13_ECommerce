# 13_ECommerce
This app is an example of an e-commerce back end. Some of the technology that was used:
* node
* sequelize
* express
* Postman

This homework was a bit challenging for me. It required me to reach out to my Tutor, do my own researching, and reach out to the BCS Learning Assistants that come with this bootcamp.

## User Story
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
